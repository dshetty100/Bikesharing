# NYC Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

In this project we analyze NYC CitiBike bikesharing data from August, 2019, using Tableau. The purpose of the analysis is to make presentation to a potential investor who is interested in developing a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis is aimed at answering few key questions:

- Who uses bikeshare programs?
- What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
- What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
- How much are the bikes used and by whom?

## Results

### 1. Customer Information
The image below shows that more than 3/4 of the users are Subscribers, who make regular use of the bikes and are a predictable source of income for the program. Bikeshare program users are also predominantly male, at approximately 5/8 to only about 1/4 female. The remaining 1/8 gender is unknown or undeclared.

### 2. Ride Starting Location
The above map displays the bike stations from which recorded bike trips started. The size of the circles and darkness of the green indicate the relative number of trips started at those locations. It is apparent that the bulk of the bike trips are originating in the bustling commercial heart of Lower Manhattan, known for towering office buildings, densely packed residential skyscrapers, and entertainment venues. Bike usage is lower in the less densely packed surrounding neighborhoods.
