# NYC Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

### 1. Customer Information

In this project we analyze NYC CitiBike bikesharing data from August, 2019, using Tableau. The purpose of the analysis is to make presentation to a potential investor who is interested in developing a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis is aimed at answering few key questions:

- Who uses bikeshare programs?
- What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
- What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
- How much are the bikes used and by whom?

The entire Tableau story can be seen by clicking at [this link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dinesh.shetty/viz/NYC_Bike_Analysis_16372636521530/NYCityBikeAnalysis?publish=yes)
## Results

The image below shows that more than 3/4 of the users are Subscribers, who make regular use of the bikes and are a predictable source of income for the program. Bikeshare program users are also predominantly male, at approximately 5/8 to only about 1/4 female. The remaining 1/8 gender is unknown or undeclared.
