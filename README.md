# NYC Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

In this project we analyze NYC CitiBike bikesharing data from August, 2019, using Tableau. The purpose of the analysis is to make presentation to a potential investor who is interested in developing a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis is aimed at answering few key questions:

- Who uses bikeshare programs?
- What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
- What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
- How much are the bikes used and by whom?
